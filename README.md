Sample Project
This project is a demonstration of creating a modular architecture using a multi-framework approach, incorporating the Factory pattern. The goal is to showcase a clean, maintainable, and scalable structure for iOS applications.

To explore the project, open MyFirstModule.xcworkspace.

What's Inside
The workspace contains several sub-projects, each serving a distinct purpose:

1. App
This directory contains the main app bundle. It acts as the entry point of the application and integrates various modules to deliver a cohesive user experience.

2. Modules
This directory contains two distinct feature sets:

Chat: Handles all functionalities related to messaging and communication.
UserProfile: Manages user-related information and profile settings.
3. Service
This directory contains shared services used across multiple features. These services are designed to be reusable and provide common functionalities required by different modules.

4. Utils
This directory contains utility classes and helper functions that are shared across the entire project. These utilities aim to reduce redundancy and improve code maintainability.

5. Dependencies
This directory contains the public protocols for all modules. By defining interfaces and contracts here, we ensure loose coupling between modules and facilitate easy integration and testing.

Architecture Overview
Modular Architecture
The project is structured in a modular fashion to promote separation of concerns and improve scalability. Each module is self-contained and encapsulates its own functionality.

Factory Pattern
The Factory pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This promotes flexibility and allows for easy extension of the project by adding new modules or features.
